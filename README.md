# Passenger-Experience-Predictor-Flight-Satisfaction-Analysis
This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting airline passenger satisfaction using real-world survey data. The objective is to help airlines understand key drivers of passenger sentiment and leverage data-driven strategies to improve service delivery.

## üîç Problem Statement

To predict whether an airline passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied based on travel-related features, and identify actionable insights to enhance the in-flight experience.

## üß∞ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **EDA & Visualization**: Seaborn, Plotly (express, graph_objs, subplots, offline, figure_factory)
- **ML Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Bagging, AdaBoost, XGBoost
- **Feature Interpretation**: XGBoost.get_booster(), SHAP
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ Key Highlights

- Conducted thorough data preprocessing including handling class imbalance and outliers
- Built multiple classification models; selected **XGBoost** as final model for best generalization score
- Used `XGBoost.get_booster()` to interpret feature importance from a business perspective
- Achieved **96% accuracy**, outperforming baseline models and delivering robust predictions
- Visualized insights using dynamic dashboards and interactive charts via Plotly

## üìä Outcome

- Enabled targeted service improvements based on top contributing factors to dissatisfaction
- Delivered reliable model for passenger sentiment prediction with high precision
- Demonstrated end-to-end ML pipeline suitable for deployment and stakeholder presentation
